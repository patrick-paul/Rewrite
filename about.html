      <span>Re-Write</span> as how it's name is,<br />
      Re-Write is designed and programmed to rewrite <br />
      what ever the user is feeling to rewrite. <br />
      It can be some repeating words or any other <br />
      kind of short text that can be rewrited

      <br />
      <br />
      "I Created re-Write when I had a problem <br />
      of trying to rewrite the same resembling words <br />
      over a thousand times. <br />
      And so after I completed creating it,<br />I decided to ship my Idea to
      the world <br />
      as how realy artists do!!!
      <br />
      From the Quote of Steve Jobs <br />
